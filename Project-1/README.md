# Project-1
Group project on finding easy to make recipes!

# User Story
We are FOODIE we provide more than 100 fantastic recipes, all at the click of a button.
We provide you with the ingredients required and the go-to recipe to make some fantastic dishes which are also easy to follow. 
We can also provide recommendations for my more adventurous people with a random selection of our most popular recipes to create a much more excitement experience.
The project was inspired by the previous lockdowns we just been through the last 18 months.
We tried to create a more creative and enjoyable way to recreate popular meals within the comforts of your own home.
